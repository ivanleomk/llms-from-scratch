# Introduction

This is a repository called llms-from-scratch that contain the code for building a language model from scratch. I'm using this to benchmark different changes that I've made and using them to learn more about the inner workings about a language model.

Things done so far

1. [BPE](./bpe/) : This implements a simple BPE tokenizer and we iteratively have a more complex version that gets more complex.
